<h1 class="first" id="descriptionAnchor">Description</h1>
<p>This object represents a <strong>connection string</strong> to Amazon environment. It has three fields:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Access key to connect to Amazon;</li>
	<li>Security key to connect to Amazon;</li>
	<li>Environment name.</li>
</ol>
<p>This object also has some logic, for instance, to read these fields from the properties file:</p>
<div class="demo" style="width:400px">
    <strong>supperSlonic.aws.key</strong>=dk4546kkv6v<br />
    <strong>supperSlonic.aws.secret_key</strong>=kfjldjfkljelkjlkjglkjrlj<br />
    <strong>supperSlonic.aws.environment</strong>=test
</div>
<p>Moreover, it has a method that creates <strong>AWSCredentials</strong> based on the provided keys.<br />
If you don’t provide access and security keys when getting AWSCredentials, the application will try to get <strong>temporary credentials</strong> generated by Amazon.
This can be useful, for instance, if your application is already running on <strong>Amazon EC2 instance</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Environment name</strong> allows you to run several environments simultaneously on Amazon: development, test, production etc.</p>
